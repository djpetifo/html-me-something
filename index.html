            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>I started to learn HTML in October of 2019. I started on freecodecamp
               with their responsive web design section and picked up on the concepts fairly
               quickly. I'm currently looking through Mozilla Developer Network to get some of the
               nuances of using HTML, such as making tables, having nested elements for use in CSS and
               SEO/accessibility best practices. I've already gotten a hold of the basics but there is
               always more to learn! 
            </p>

            <p>Today I'm using my HTML powers to make some nice markup that will work well
               with grid and flexbox. I make sure to give my elements classes if they will
               receiving common declarations and I put IDs on items that I will need to
               work with in a JavaScript file. Once I'm a little more comfortable, maybe
               I'll try my hand at using the hidden attribute to hide articles that aren't
               being referenced and bring up articles that are selected in the navigation.
               That is an experiment for later though.

        <article id="css">
            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>I began learning CSS around the same time that I started HTML, admittedly I
               have yet to fully master all the concepts of CSS. I am aware that the grid
               for my superpowers is not responsive at the moment, I plan to fix that Once
               I have a little more know-how. The plan is to have the images form an upside-down 
               triangle for medium sized screens and a straight line for small screens.

            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <p>
               Finally! The meat and potatoes, DOM manipulation, event handling, scripting,
               React and Angular. I've done a little bit of everything with JavaScript at
               this point. I started learning JavaScript in about January of 2020. I had
               previously read the entirety of the documentation for Python and done a good
               amount of coding challenges on Code Wars in Python. With that experience I was
               able to pick up JavaScript relatively quickly. By February I started doing some
               HackerRank problems just to familiarize myself with the different built in objects
               and methods. 
            </p>

            <p>
               Currently, I'm trying to get a better grasp of basic and intermediate data structures
               and algorithmns. I've spent the last couple of weekends going though C's standard
               library and recreating linked lists, trees, tries, queues and stacks in JavaScript.
               My goal is to familiarize myself with the methods that are required by each data
               structure and get familiar with some common use cases and algorithms for each.
